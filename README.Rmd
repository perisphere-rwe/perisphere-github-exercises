# perisphere-github-exercises

This repository is used to provide hands-on exercises designed to build familiarity with git and GitHub. It also uses `pericircle` and is based on `pericircumference`, so it also helps to build familiarity with those tools.

## Preliminary exercises

1. Clone this repository (i.e., repo) to a new local project (hint: `usethis::create_from_github()`)

1. Make sure all the packages in `packages.R` and in `doc/results.Rmd` are installed.

1. Run `targets::tar_glimpse()` in the R console to view the targets pipeline in this project. You should see this flowchart:

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('screen-tar_glimpse.png')
```

1. Run `targets::tar_make()` in the R console. If the pipeline runs successfully, it will produce an output file: `doc/results-v1/results-perisphere-github-exercises-v1-0.docx`. Open this file and verify that you see a table of contents at the top that looks like this:

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('screen-doc_toc.png')
```

Scroll to table 1 and verify you see output like this:

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('screen-doc_tbl_1.png')
```

You've successfully cloned this project and reproduced the results it creates! Now you'll add your own changes and submit a pull request

## git exercises

1. Switch to your terminal in Rstudio (or whatever interface you use for git) and run `git status`
