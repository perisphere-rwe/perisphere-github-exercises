# packages are usually handled by packages.R (in main directory).
# When tar_make() is run, it loads everything in packages.R.
# Assuming this document is in the list of targets (see ?tar_render),
# you won't need to include the library calls below.
# however, the template includes packages in its initial form
# so that you can knit the document without having to run tar_make().
# The library calls can safely be removed once the required packages
# are in packages.R and this doc is part of the targets pipeline.

Essentials for writing text are shown here. Demonstrations include creating a section and subsection, writing items in a bulleted list, citing items that are defined in `refs.bib`, and inserting R objects into the text.

# Section

A bulleted list:

- Results were produced with R version `r r_version`.[@r_language]

- Here's how to cite two or more things.[@orsf_aoas; @aorsf_joss; @aorsf_jcgs]

## Subsection

Here's how to put some results into the text: A total of `r tv(stats$.overall$nobs)` were included in the current analysis. The mean bill length was `r tv(stats$.overall$mean_bill_length)`. The mean (standard deviation) body mass was `r with(stats$.overall, tg("{mean_mass} ({sd_mass})"))`

# References

In case they are needed.

<div id="refs"></div>

\newpage

# Tables

A convention worth following is to make each table a sub section. This makes the table easier to find from the table of contents and also from the built-in Rstudio navigator. Another good convention is to start a new page for each table (use the `\newpage` command)

\newpage



## Table 1: Penguin characteristics

```{r}

footer_tbl_val <- "Table values are n (%) or mean (SD)"

data %>% 
  infuse_dictionary(meta, units = 'descriptive') %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = 'island', missing = 'no',
  statistic = list(
    all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})",  # Mean and SD for continuous
    all_categorical() ~ "{n} ({p}%)"  # Custom format for categorical
  )) %>% 
  modify_footnote(c(all_stat_cols()) ~ NA) %>% 
  as_flex_table() %>% 
  theme_box() %>% 
  add_footer_lines(footer_tbl_val) %>% 
  align(j = c(2,3,4), align = 'center', part = 'all')

```

\newpage

## Table 2: A more customized table

```{r}

data %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  slice(1:3) %>% 
  select(-body_mass_g, -sex, -year) %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), table_value)) %>% 
  as_grouped_data(groups = 'island') %>% 
  # infuse after as_grouped_data, b/c as_grouped_data can
  # wipe away attributes, which will delete your labels.
  infuse_dictionary(meta, units = 'descriptive') %>% 
  as_flextable(hide_grouplabel = TRUE) %>% 
  add_header_row(values = c(" ", " Penguin things"),
                 colwidths = c(1, 3)) %>% 
  bg(i = ~!is.na(species), bg = 'grey90') %>% 
  width(width = 1.5) %>% 
  width(j = 1, width = 2) %>% 
  align(part = 'all', j = c(2,3,4), align = 'center') %>% 
  footnote(i = 2, j = 2, 
           part = 'header',
           value = as_paragraph("Chinstraps boast the highest average bill length."),
           ref_symbols = '1') %>% 
  footnote(i = 1, j = 1, 
           part = 'body',
           value = as_paragraph('Adelies know they are a crowd favorite'), 
           ref_symbols = '2') %>% 
  add_footer_lines(values = abbrvs_write(abbrvs[c('CI', 'EHR', 'SD')])) %>% 
  add_footer_lines(values = "none of those abbreviations are in the table but they demonstrate how to include abbreviations using my helper functions")

```
\newpage

## Table 3: Characteristics for Penguin Species subgroups
```{r}

footer_tbl_val <- "Table values are n (%) or median (25th, 75th percentile)"

data %>% 
  infuse_dictionary(meta, units = 'descriptive') %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = 'species', missing = 'no') %>% 
  modify_footnote(c(all_stat_cols()) ~ NA) %>% 
  as_flex_table() %>% 
  theme_box() %>% 
  add_footer_lines(footer_tbl_val) %>% 
  align(j = c(2,3,4), align = 'center', part = 'all')


```

<!-- new page not needed at the end of a block section -->


To make a landscape section, use the block_section code here. Note that the section will be applied to all content prior to the block reaching up to the most recent block.



To switch back to regular portrait section, add another portrait block. Notice how the block below acts on all content above it up to the prior block.

\newpage

# Figures

The default figure margins are set by the `page_long_above()` and `page_wide_above()`. You can change those to your preference by either modifying the functions or by setting `fig.width` and `fig.height` in the code chunk that prints the figure.

\newpage

## Figure 1: Penguin dimensions (normal version)

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}

fig <- ggplot(data = data) + 
  aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species) + 
  geom_point()

fig

```

There is a `theme_set()` command at the beginning of the document that sets our preferred `ggplot` theme. It aims to use the same font family and font size in the plots as is used in the text. I recommend changing the `ggplot` theming if you decide to use a different style for the word doc. If you want to just lightly modify the theme for specific plots, you can use the `theme()` function to add your flair. 


\newpage

## Figure 2: Penguin dimensions (wide version)

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}

fig + 
  theme(panel.border = element_blank())

```

\newpage

## Figure 3: Penguin dimensions (Flipper length vs. Body mass)

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}

fig3 <- ggplot(data = data) + 
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species) + 
  geom_point()

fig3
```


Hang on, how did the figure size change? That is an intended side effect of `page_long_above()` and `page_wide_above()`. Notably, if you ever want to avoid this convenient side effect, you can override it by setting `fig.width = X` and `fig.height = Y` where X and Y are your preferred figure width and height, in inches.
