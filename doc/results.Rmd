# Hello! This is the template word document for Perisphere reports.
# There are several code chunks used to set up the format of the
# document below. You don't have to modify those unless you want 
# to change the format of your output.

# packages are usually handled by packages.R (in main directory).
# When tar_make() is run, it loads everything in packages.R.
# Assuming this document is in the list of targets (see ?tar_render),
# you won't need to include the library calls below.
# however, the template includes packages in its initial form
# so that you can knit the document without having to run tar_make().
# The library calls can safely be removed once the required packages
# are in packages.R and this doc is part of the targets pipeline.

# standards for word docs
library(officer)
library(flextable)

# specify a rounding specification 
library(table.glue)

# general purpose

\newpage

Essentials for writing text are shown here. Demonstrations include creating a section and subsection, writing items in a bulleted list, citing items that are defined in `refs.bib`, and inserting R objects into the text.

# Section

A bulleted list:

- Results were produced with R version `r r_version`.[@r_language]

- Here's how to cite two or more things.[@orsf_aoas; @aorsf_joss; @aorsf_jcgs]

## Subsection

Here's how to put some results into the text: A total of `r tv(stats$.overall$nobs)` were included in the current analysis. The mean bill length was `r tv(stats$.overall$mean_bill_length)`. The mean (standard deviation) body mass was `r with(stats$.overall, tg("{mean_mass} ({sd_mass})"))`

# References

In case they are needed.

<div id="refs"></div>

\newpage

# Tables

A convention worth following is to make each table a sub section. This makes the table easier to find from the table of contents and also from the built-in Rstudio navigator. Another good convention is to start a new page for each table (use the `\newpage` command)

\newpage



## Table 1: Penguin characteristics

```{r}

footer_tbl_val <- "Table values are n (%) or median (25th, 75th percentile)"

data %>% 
  infuse_dictionary(meta, units = 'descriptive') %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = 'island', missing = 'no') %>% 
  modify_footnote(c(all_stat_cols()) ~ NA) %>% 
  as_flex_table() %>% 
  theme_box() %>% 
  add_footer_lines(footer_tbl_val) %>% 
  align(j = c(2,3,4), align = 'center', part = 'all')

```

\newpage

## Table 2: A more customized table

```{r}

data %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  slice(1:3) %>% 
  select(-body_mass_g, -sex, -year) %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), table_value)) %>% 
  as_grouped_data(groups = 'species') %>% 
  # infuse after as_grouped_data, b/c as_grouped_data can
  # wipe away attributes, which will delete your labels.
  infuse_dictionary(meta, units = 'descriptive') %>% 
  as_flextable(hide_grouplabel = TRUE) %>% 
  add_header_row(values = c(" ", " Penguin things"),
                 colwidths = c(1, 3)) %>% 
  bg(i = ~!is.na(species), bg = 'grey90') %>% 
  width(width = 1.5) %>% 
  width(j = 1, width = 2) %>% 
  align(part = 'all', j = c(2,3,4), align = 'center') %>% 
  footnote(i = 2, j = 2, 
           part = 'header',
           value = as_paragraph("Chinstraps boast the highest average bill length."),
           ref_symbols = '1') %>% 
  footnote(i = 1, j = 1, 
           part = 'body',
           value = as_paragraph('Adelies know they are a crowd favorite'), 
           ref_symbols = '2') %>% 
  add_footer_lines(values = abbrvs_write(abbrvs[c('CI', 'EHR', 'SD')])) %>% 
  add_footer_lines(values = "none of those abbreviations are in the table but they demonstrate how to include abbreviations using my helper functions")

```


<!-- new page not needed at the end of a block section -->

`r page_long_above()`

To make a landscape section, use the block_section code here. Note that the section will be applied to all content prior to the block reaching up to the most recent block.

`r page_wide_above()`

To switch back to regular portrait section, add another portrait block. Notice how the block below acts on all content above it up to the prior block.

\newpage

# Figures

The default figure margins are set by the `page_long_above()` and `page_wide_above()`. You can change those to your preference by either modifying the functions or by setting `fig.width` and `fig.height` in the code chunk that prints the figure.

\newpage

## Figure 1: Penguin dimensions (normal version)

```{r}

fig <- ggplot(data = data) + 
  aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species) + 
  geom_point()

fig

```

There is a `theme_set()` command at the beginning of the document that sets our preferred `ggplot` theme. It aims to use the same font family and font size in the plots as is used in the text. I recommend changing the `ggplot` theming if you decide to use a different style for the word doc. If you want to just lightly modify the theme for specific plots, you can use the `theme()` function to add your flair. 

`r page_long_above()`


## Figure 2: Penguin dimensions (wide version)

```{r}

fig + 
  theme(panel.border = element_blank())

```

Hang on, how did the figure size change? That is an intended side effect of `page_long_above()` and `page_wide_above()`. Notably, if you ever want to avoid this convenient side effect, you can override it by setting `fig.width = X` and `fig.height = Y` where X and Y are your preferred figure width and height, in inches.

`r page_wide_above()`
